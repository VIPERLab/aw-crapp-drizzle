# `aw-crapp`

A very-opinionated, `deadline-looming-oriented` React starter-kit.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

---
## Setup
- Rename `.env.sample` to `.env`
- `yarn install`
- `yarn start`

---
### Additions
- [`vudu`](https://github.com/dhunninghake/vudu) in place of CSS.
- Commonly needed tooling including `redux`, `react-router`, `redux-thunk`, etc.
- A `stern-but-fair` `eslint` configuration.
- `/constants` with variables useful for `redux-promise-middleware` and common breakpoints for `vudu` / `react-media`.
- A generic `Text` component configured to work with `vudu` base copy styles.
